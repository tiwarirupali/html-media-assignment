#Describe the rules for defining identifiers in python with examples.
Python Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
That means whenever we want to give an entity a name, that's called identifier.
They are case-sensitive.
"a" and "A" are not the same.
They begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore (_).
They include any combination of alphabetic characters, numerals, and underscore characters. ...
All characters are significant.
