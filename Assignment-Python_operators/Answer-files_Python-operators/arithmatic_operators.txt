#calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers

a & b are two varriables in which we have assigned values 2 and 5 respectively.
using operators like sum(*), difference(-), product(*) and quotient(/) we will do the calculation.

a=2
b=5

#sum(+) operator
x=a+b
x
7 (7 is the sum using + operator)

#difference(-) operator
y=b-2
y
3 (3 is the difference using - operator)

#product(*) operator
z=a*b
z
10 (10 is the product using * operator)

#sum(/) operator
d=a/b
d
0.4 (0.4 is the quotient using / operator)
